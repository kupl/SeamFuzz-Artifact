### Operating System 
We recommend using **Ubuntu 20.04** to run our artifact as the experiments were done on Ubuntu 20.04.
The artifact maynot proerply work on MacOS.

### and Hardware Requirements
There is no strict restrictions on hardware, but we recommend to use machines with at least 20 cores and 128GB RAM
to run a single experiment(20 trials on a single benchmark program with a single fuzzer) properly.
The remaining hard disk space should be more than **300GB**.
