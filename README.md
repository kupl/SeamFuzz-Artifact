# SeamFuzz-Artifact
This repository is for the implementation of our paper accepted in ICSE 2023, "Learning Seed-Adaptive Mutation Strategies for
Greybox Fuzzing".
Our tool, [SeamFuzz](https://github.com/kupl/SeamFuzz-public), is a grey-box mutation-based fuzzer built on [AFL++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus).

# Setup
All experiments in our paper was done on [FuzzBench](https://github.com/google/fuzzbench) framework,
and therefore, the setup environments for our artifact is the same as the one for [FuzzBench](https://github.com/google/fuzzbench).
Please refer to the following [link](https://google.github.io/fuzzbench/) to establish the experimental environments.
You can also follow the instructions below to construct/evaluate SeamFuzz on FuzzBench.
