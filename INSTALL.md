# Setup
## Building SeamFuzz for Fuzzbench
All experiments in our paper was done on [FuzzBench](https://github.com/google/fuzzbench) framework,
and therefore, the setup environments for our artifact is the same as the one for [FuzzBench](https://github.com/google/fuzzbench).
Please refer to the following [link](https://google.github.io/fuzzbench/) to establish the experimental environments.
You can also follow the instructions below to construct/evaluate SeamFuzz on FuzzBench.

We modified some parts of FuzzBench to evaluate some benchmark programs (objdump, infotocap, podofopdfinfo, magma_libxml2_xmllint) as follows:
```
fuzzbench
└── experiment
|   └── measurer
|       └── run_coverage.py : "do_coverage_run" function is modified to properly evaluate some benchmark programs
└── fuzzers
|   └── afl
|   └── fuzzer.py         : "run_afl_fuzz" function is modified to properly evaluate some benchmark programs
|   └── aflpp : "build.Dockerfile" is modified to make the version of "AFL++" be the same as the one of SeamFuzz
|   └── aflppmopt : "build.Dockerfile" is modified to make the version of "AFL++" be the same as the one of SeamFuzz
...
```
If the users want to evaluate our fuzzers on the FuzzBench framework from original git, 
please modify the files above.
Otherwise, FuzzBench may not properly work on some benchmark programs we provide.

### Using VM(VirtualMachine) 
We also provide a VM image file which contain all contents to evaluate the experiments.
The VM image is built on [VirtualBox 7.0](https://www.virtualbox.org).
You can donwload the VM image from the following link.

The sudo user password is set to "1234"

### From Source
As we mentioned in [REQUIREMENTS.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md), the FuzzBench we provided in this repository recommend to use **python-3.9**.

Following command will install the prerequisites for running fuzzbench.  

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv python3-pip docker  python3.9-venv python3.9-dev docker docker-compose
```

After installing docker, users are recommended to make 

```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
sudo service docker restart
```

The command below will setup FuzzBench framework on a local machine.
```
cd ./fuzzbench & make
```


## Building SeamFuzz without FuzzBench
The source code for SeamFuzz is on ./fuzzbench/fuzzers/seamfuzz/afl. 
As SeamFuzz is built on AFL++, the installation process for SeamFuzz is the same as AFL++.
Please follow the instructions in [AFL++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus) to build SeamFuzz on a local machine.
