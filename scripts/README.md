* fuzzer.txt                : a list of fuzzers for evaluation
* count_crash_inputs.sh     : a script file to count the crash inputs generated by each fuzzer
* generate_table.py         : a python file to generate a result table of the evaluation (requires pandas, matplotlib_venn3)
* get_implemented_target.sh : a script file to get the implemented benchmark program and the fuzzer from docker image (built on FuzzBench)
* make_local_config.sh      : a script file to make a local configuration file for evaluationg FuzzBench on a local machine
* run_fuzzbench.sh          : a script file to run fuzzbench with using all scripts above.
