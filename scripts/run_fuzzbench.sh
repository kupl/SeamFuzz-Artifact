# TIME: the seconds for the running experiments. The default value is 86400, which is 24 hours
# [EXP_PATH]: the path for storing the running data of FuzzBench. must be given as an absolute path. The default path is the working directory/data/
# [REPORT]: the path for storing the report of FuzzBench. must be given as an absolute path. The default path is the working directory/report/
# [EXP_PATH]: the name of the experiments which will be stored in [EXP_PATH]. The default name is maineval
# [FUZZBENCH_PATH]: the path for fuzzbench
# [BENCHMARK_PATH]: the "bench" file which specify benchmark programs for evaluation. "bench" file is in scripts directory
