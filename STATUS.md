## Reusable and Available
We are applying for the two badges, Available and Reusable badges. 
We believe that our artifact satisfies the requirements for the two badges for the three reasons:

1. We have made our artifact **available** on [Github](https://github.com/kupl/SeamFuzz-Artifact) and [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7578055).
2. We offered all the benchmarks and fuzzers used in the evaluation with script files which can reproduce the experimental results of our paper. 
The documents are included to guide users be able to follow the experiment process.
3. We also provided a virtual machine image file with all requirements pre-installed, as well as the source codes. The public git repository contains documents which can help users install and use our tool. So we believe that other researchers are are able to easily **reuse** our tool.mprove our tool easily in their own research.
