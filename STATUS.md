## Reusable and Available

We would like to apply for Available and Reusable badges:

1. We have made our artifact **available** on [Github](https://github.com/kupl/SeamFuzz-Artifact) and Zenodo.
   The DOI link is as: ??
2. We provided all the benchmarks used in the evaluation and script files for reproducing the main experimental results of our paper.
3. We also provided a virtual machine image file with all requirements pre-installed, as well as the source codes. The public git repository contains documents which can guide users to install and use our tool. So we believe that other researchers are able to **reuse** and improve our tool easily in their own research.
