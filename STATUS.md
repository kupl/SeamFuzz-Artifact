## Reusable and Available

We would like to apply for Available and Reusable badges:

1. We have made our artifact **available** on [Github](https://github.com/kupl/SeamFuzz-Artifact) and Zenodo.
   The DOI link is as: ??
2. We provided all the benchmarks used in the evaluation and script files for reproducing the main experimental results of our paper.
3. We also provided a virtual machine image file with all requirements pre-installed, as well as the source codes. The public git repository contains documents which can guide users be able to install and to use our tool. So we believe that other researchers are able to **reuse** and improve our tool easily in their own research.
